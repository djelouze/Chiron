Chiron compilation process:

I assume that you are under linux and that you clone the Chiron repo into:
~/Codes/Chiron
The following steps are illustrated with linux commands

- Compile the current CVS revision of ParaView. For that, you will need Qt and
CMake (check versions on the paraview website).
- Create an out-of-source build directory and cd-in
   mkdir ~/Softwares/Chiron
   cd ~/Softwares/Chiron
- Execute CMake with the Chiron's CMakeLists
   ccmake ~/Codes/Chiron
- Choose your build type (debug or release or...)
- Set the ParaView directory: it is the built directory
   [~/Softwares/ParaView-3.7/Debug]
- Configure
   [press 'c'] 2x
- Generate
   [press 'g']
- Now compile with your preferred IDE or make.
- Once the compilation is done (less than 1 minute), the plugin is loadable
   in ParaView -> Tools -> Plugin Manager -> Load New -> libChironToolbar.so

-------------------------------
Note on documentation :
During the CMake step, you are proposed to build the documentation.
This is a Doxygen generated doc, so you *need* doxygen. If you choose "Yes",
the documentation will be generated at the next "Configure" in CMake. It should
take some times.
