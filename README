Chiron is a Cxx library providing essentially ParaView(1) plugins. The main
plugin is a toolbar that activates different modules, aiming at giving to the
GUI a medical imaging software look-and-feel.

The idea behind this is to harness the parallel computing/rendering framework
natively handled by ParaView while providing an user-friendly GUI according to
the medical professionals habits.

Chiron is open source (GPL, see COPYING for details). This is intended to
change in order to match the ParaView licence (BSD). The git head branch of this
repo is compiled againt the current CVS version of ParaView.

Currently, no binaries are provided. You have to compile your own ParaView and 
then compile Chiron. Use CMake(2) and read INSTALL.


(1) ParaView is an opensource software dedicated to parallel visualisation.
Go to http://www.paraview.org and simply enjoy.
(2) CMake is cross-plateform meta-compiler. Go to http://www.cmake.org and use
it.
